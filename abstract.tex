The Vera C.  Rubin Observatory is an 8m-class optical facility currently
under construction on Cherro Pach√≥n, Chile.  During the 10-year Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST) starting in 2022 the Vera C.  Rubin
Observatory will scan the entire accessible night sky roughly every 3 days. 
A special observational cadence allows for the discovery and
characterization of millions of Solar System Objects, among them roughly two
thirds of all near-Earth Objects (NEOs) with absolute magnitude $H < 22$~mag. 
Data products encompass a near real time alert stream to enable rapid
follow-up as well as orbit catalogs exclusively based on high precision
astrometry published on a yearly basis.  The latter are valuable input for
population debiasing and future survey simulation studies.  Here, we present
an overview of the expected Solar System Processing capabilities during the
LSST.
